	\item Licenses, Franchise rights
	\item Brand value
	\item Customer lists
	\item Goodwill
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Statement of Cash Flows}

Financial statements links

$A = L  + SE$ \\
$\Delta A = \Delta L + \Delta SE $ \\
$\Delta Cash = - \Delta NonCashAssets + \Delta L + \Delta SE $ \\

It has three sections

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item \textbf{Operating}: Primary business activities.
	\item \textbf{Investing}: Acquiring and selling productive assets.
	\item \textbf{Financing}: Related to external sources of financing
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Working Capital (WC)}


$WC = CurrentAssets - CurrentLiabilities$ \\
$Non-Cash-WC = CurrentAssets - Cash - CurrentLiabilities $ \\

CFO : Cash Flow from operations
NI: Net Income
$ CFO = NI - Accruals $ \\

Start with Net Income, then: \\
1) \textbf{Add non cash expenses}: expenses that reduce NI \\
2) \textbf{Add (subtract) gains (losses)} associated with investing activities \\
3) \textbf{Add (subtract)} changes in non-cash WC. e.g. if A/R decreases by \$100, add \$100 to NI. If A/R decreases by by \$100, subtract \$100 to NI. \\

$FreeCashFlow = OperatingCashFlow - CapEx$ \\

Accruals are the difference between net income and cash flow from operations, that is: \\

$Net Income = Cash Flow from Operations + Accruals$ \\
$Accruals = Net Income - Cash Flow from Operations$ \\

Change in Cash = Cash Flow From Operations (CFO) + Cash Flow From Investing + Cash Flow From Financing

$Beg. Retained Earnings + Net Income â€“ Dividends(Divs) = End. Retained Earnings$
