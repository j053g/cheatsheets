\section*{Week 2: Revenue Recognition; Allowance Accounting}

\subsection*{Old Revenue Recognition Principles}
Earnings = Revenues – Expenses \\
Old Revenue Recognition Intuition:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Earned} Earnings process substantially complete
	\item \textbf{Collectible} Cash collection reasonably assured
\end{itemize}
Expenses matched to revenues by matching principle


\subsection*{Bad Debts}

Two ways of accounting for bad debts:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item the direct method: required for income taxes. cons: 
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item Improper matching of expenses to revenues
		\item More reliable info but less relevant (i.e. less timely)
	\end{itemize}
	\item the allowance method: two methods
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item percentage of sales
		\item aging method.
	\end{itemize}

A/R (net) = A/R (gross) – Allowance for doubtful accounts (ADA)
A/R (net) = A/R (gross) - ending ADA
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The BASE equation}

\textbf{B}eginning balance\\
+ \textbf{A}dditions \\
- \textbf{S}ubstractions \\
= \textbf{E}nding Balance

Example: \\

\textbf{B}eginning balance (e.g. ADA - allowance for doutful accounts) \\
+ \textbf{A}dditions (e.g. bad debt expense a.k.a. provision charged to income statement)\\
- \textbf{S}ubstractions (e.g. write-offs a.k.a. amount deemed uncollectible) \\
= \textbf{E}nding Balance

Beginning ADA + Bad Debt Expense – Amounts Written Off = Ending ADA


\subsection*{Allowance Method 2: Aging Method}


\subsection*{Ratios Involving Receivables}

A/R Turnover = Revenue / Average Accounts Receivable (net)

Days receivables = (1 / A/R Turnover) * 365

\subsection*{Liability for Return Allowances}

Allowances for product returns are very similar to the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, except that Allowances for product returns are a liability, whereas Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra-asset.

\subsection*{Key Terms and Usage}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item \textbf{A/R}:Acconts Receivable.
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item Customer purchases' made on account (i.e. you will receive a payment later
		\item I/S: Revenue is recognized when earned, not received
		\item B/S: Asset account impacted 
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ADA}:Allowance for doubtful accounts 
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item Company provisions for uncollectible A/R
		\item I/S: Depends on how it changes
		\item B/S: Contra-asset account impacted
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{BDE}: Bad debt expense
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item Future projections for uncollectible A/R
		\item I/S: Expense recognized as \% of sales
		\item B/S: Increase ADA account by same amount
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Write-off}
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item A/R that “goes bad” in that time period (i.e. it becomes clear that the customer cannot pay)
		\item  I/S: No impact
		\item  B/S: Reduce ADA and A/R
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}
