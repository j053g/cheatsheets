\section*{Week 7: Long-Term Debt and Leases}

\subsection*{Bonds}

For financial accounting purposes: \\
$Interest Expense$ = market rate at the time the bond is issued × net bond payable \\
$Interest Payable$ = coupon rate × par amount \\
The difference between interest expense and interest payable is amortized against the bond discount (premium) account.
A bond issued at par value (i.e., Coupon Rate = Market Rate).
A zero coupon bond (i.e., Coupon Rate = 0\%)

\subsection*{Leases}

	"Rental" & Operating & Operating \\

\subsection*{Financial Lease} 

 Both the asset and liability are valued at the PV of lease $n$ payments $pmt$ at interest rate $r$. \\
 $PV_0\texttt{=PV(r,n,pmt)}$ 
 
 When signing the lease:\\
 	\begin{tabular}{ |c||c|c| } 
 	\hline
 	Assets  & Liability  & S/E \\ 
 	Lease A & Lease L  &  \\ 
 	\hline
 	$PV_0$ & $PV_0$  &  \\ 
 	\hline
 \end{tabular}

During the lease (t-th period): \\
 	\begin{tabular}{ |c|c||c|c| } 
	\hline
	Assets  & & Liability  & S/E \\ 
	Cash & -Acc Depr  & Lease L & Ret Earn  \\ 
	\hline
	$-pmt$ & & $-(pmt-r\cdot PV_{t-1})$ &  $-r\cdot PV_{t-1}$ \\
	\hline
	       & $\frac{PV_0}{n}$ &    & $-\frac{PV_0}{n}$  \\
	\hline
\end{tabular} 
$pmt \neq LeaseExpense$. 
the rest of the period the logic continues amortizing the lease liability, the lease expense uses the remaining lease balance, the lease asset is depreciated using straight-line.

\subsection*{Operating Lease} 
At the signing of lease is the same as financing leases. During the lease (t-th period): \\
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c||c|c| } 
	\hline
	Assets  & & Liability  & S/E \\ 
	Cash & Lease A  & Lease L & Ret Earn  \\ 
	\hline
	$-pmt$ &    & $-pmt$ &   \\
	\hline
           & $r \cdot PV_{t-1} -pmt$ & $r \cdot PV_{t-1}$      & $-pmt$  \\
	\hline
\end{tabular} \\
$pmt = LeaseExpense$. This two line items can be combined.
No amortization expense, the lease asset does not have an acc. amort. contra asset, both lease asset and liability amortize over time.
