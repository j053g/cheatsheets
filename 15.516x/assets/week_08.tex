\section*{Week 8: Shareholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share}

\subsection*{Earnings Per Share}

$Basic EPS = \frac{NIavailableToCommonShareholders}{Weighted Average Shares Outstanding}$ \\

$Numerator = NI - NI attributable to noncontrolling interest - Preferred dividends $ \\


$Diluted EPS = \frac{NIavailableToCommonShareholders+Addbacks}{Weighted Average Shares Outstanding+Conversions}$ \\

Addbacks in the numerator include dividends paid to preferred shareholders and after-tax
interest paid to convertible debt holders.
Diluted shares include convertible instruments and stock option exercises. Assume all
convertible instruments convert to common stock. Stock option exercises require more
calculations.
