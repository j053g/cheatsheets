\section*{Week 8: Shareholders' Equity and Earnings Per Share}

\subsection*{Contributed Capital: Commong Stock}

Common stock is divided into Par Value and Additional paid-in capital (APIC). Par value is the stated value on the face of the security.  APIC is the difference between capital raised and par value. \\
Underwriting expenses:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
	\item If $ Cash = Par + APIC \implies $  were subtracted from APIC.
	\item If $ Cash < Par + APIC \implies $ capitalized. An asset is created such that $Cash + Capitalized Costs = Par + APIC$ 
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Earnings Per Share}

$Basic EPS = \frac{NIavailableToCommonShareholders}{Weighted Average Shares Outstanding}$ \\

$Numerator = NI - NI attributable to noncontrolling interest - Preferred dividends $ \\


$Diluted EPS = \frac{NIavailableToCommonShareholders+Addbacks}{Weighted Average Shares Outstanding+Conversions}$ \\

Addbacks in the numerator include dividends paid to preferred shareholders and after-tax
interest paid to convertible debt holders.
Diluted shares include convertible instruments and stock option exercises. Assume all
convertible instruments convert to common stock. Stock option exercises require more
calculations.
