\section{Forward and Futures}


\subsection*{Forward Interest rates}
The forward interest rate between time $t-1$ and $t$ satisfies:\\
$ (1+r_t)^t = (1+r_{t-1})^{t-1}(1+f_t) $ \\
$ f_t = \frac{B_{t-1}}{B_t} -1 =\frac{(1+r_t)^t}{(1+r_{t-1})^{t-1}} -1 $


\subsection*{Forward price}
$F_T=e^{(r-y)T} S_0$


\subsection*{Swaps}
The swap rate is a weighted average of forward rates: \\
$r_s = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}B_t f_t}{\sum_{u=1}^{T}B_u} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t  f_t$ , 
with the weights $w_t = \frac{B_t}{\sum_{u=1}^{T} B_u}$ \\

Alternative method: $r_S=\frac{1-B_T}{\sum_{u=1}^{T}B_u}$ in the 3 year case: $r_S=\frac{1-B_3}{B_1+B_2+B_3}=\frac{1-1/(1+r_3)^2}{1/(1+r_1)+1/(1+r_2)^2+1/(1+r_3)^3}$ 


\subsection*{R11Q1:Forward Interest Rates and Arbitrage }Question 1: 
Problem is to find arbitrage from 2 spot rates and 1 forward rate, the general approach to solving this problem is to:
1. Invest $x$ at spot rate, $r_1$
2. Invest $y$ at spot rate, $r_2$
3. Invest $z$ at 1-yr forward rate in year 1, $f_1$
(a) Pays \$100 today and nothing in the future:
$-x-y = 100$ |
$(1 + r_1)x -z = 0$ |
$(1 + r_2)^2y + (1 + f_1)z = 0$ then solve system to find amounts.

\subsection*{R11Q3: Currency Forward}
Suppose that USD/JPY is trading at 105, and the 1-year forward on USD/JPY
is trading at 106. The risk-free rate in the US is 1\%, and in Japan it is 3\%.
Construct an arbitrage strategy that gives you \$100 today and nothing in the
future. {\bf solution}: Year 1 income in JPY = Year 1 liabilities in JPY
$105\times 1.03 \times (x - 100) = 106 \times 1.01 \times x$
Solving yields $x= 9922 USD$
