## General Advice for MITx Proctored Final Exams

I made this list as if I could give advise to myself before a final. I hope it you can be useful to you too:

* Make sure to read all instructions, spare no detail. Proctored software needs good badwidth and a quiet environment, make sure you don't add extra pressure to yourself by not having the right environment.  Make sure to enable your phone as hotspot connected to a portable charger in order to have an alternate internet connection in case something goes wrong with your router/internet provider/electricity.
* Make sure to review all recitations and make sure you can solve all of them without aid and without looking at the professor solution before the final. Polish areas where your knowledge is not internalized.
* Same applies for all problem sets.
* If possible, review previous finals for equivalent courses at [OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/).
* If available, mimic the final exam using a sample one, time youself.  The test is not only testing your knowledge but also your ability to handle pressure in a timed manner. Make sure you know any tool required for the exam, i.e. Excel, Python, R, etc. Do not leave this as a side issue, it's a central issue, make sure you're familiar with the tools as well as with the domain knowledge.
* Use these cheatsheets at your own risk and discretion but it's better if you make yours, it's a great exercise to review all lessons.
* Do not obsess with one particular question, leave that for later in the exam or in life. During the final, do as much as possible and leave enough time for a final review of unanswered questions.
* If the final provides feedback, have an idea of alternative answers in advance, feedback from wrong answers can actually give you the answer if you have a mental process of elimination in advance.
* Even if you think the material is "easy", the exam can twist a problem in a way that will test if you really have internalized the knowledge, it's not enough just to know a mechanical procedure, it's better to understand the problems from first priciples.
* Do the exam with humility, do not fear it and do not have overconfidence.
* Regardless of outcome or score, it's a great learning experience, accept the result, then just let it go. Learn from it and more importantly, learn to know yourself and how you handle yourself with pressure.
